The SparkFun Air Velocity Sensor Breakout - FS3000 (Qwiic) makes it easy to use the Renesas FS3000 module. The FS3000 is a surface-mount type air velocity module utilizing a
MEMS thermopile-based sensor.

The FS3000 features a digital output with 12-bit resolution. The
sensor comprises a “solid” thermal isolation technology and siliconcarbide coating to protect it from abrasive wear and water
condensation.

The FS3000 features a compact design fit for low profile
enclosures.

There are two versions of this sensor with different upper ranges (1005/1015). This SparkFun product utilizes the 1005 version which can sense 0-7.23m/s (0-16.17mph).
