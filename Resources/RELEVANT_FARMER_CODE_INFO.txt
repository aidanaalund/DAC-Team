26 ~ Tools box w/ mega + resistors + sensors + wires
27 ~ ???

Temperature address: on the actual product ? 

CO2 sensors -> use I2C
OneWire temperature

left side sensors 
right side actuators
not 1:1 

Why a multiplexer?
we have 2 CO2 sensors & 2 FLOW sensors
- both CO2 sensors have the same address
	- couldn't connect both sensors to the same pin
		because of this
	- multiplexer allows us to read these two channels individualy
	- function tcaselect lets use choose output channel for MUX
		- tcaselect(1) -> CO2 Sensor 1
		- tcaselect(2) -> CO2 Sensor 2
		- tcaselect(3) -> Flow Sensor 1
		- tcaselect(4) -> Flow Sensor 2

The addition of the mega will likely force us to coalesce CFSensorsOutputHeater
and CarbonFarmerOutputOnly together?
